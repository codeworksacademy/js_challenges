# Instructions  

**Food Processor**

### Description

Needing to create a more universal food proccessing machine. We need to write the algorith that identifies food and proccesses it accordingly. Given and array of `items` you will be required to return another array of `proccessed`.
look at the example below for expected outputs.
One rule you have to keep in mind is sea food must always be proccessed last (due to allergies), but otherwise in the order they came in.

any item on the left should be proccessed onto the food on the right

**example Output:**
```
🐟🐠🐡🐙 => 🍣
🐔🐄🐖🐊 => 🍔
🥬🌿🍅🥕 => 🥗

```
