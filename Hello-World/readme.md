# Instructions  

## Code Challenges
Hello and welcome to your first challenge warmup! These are challenges meant to be completed at your own pace to try and get your brain warmed up before the lecture.

There are a couple things we will want to keep in mind when completing these challenges so lets go over those.
- There is a lot going on behind the scenes in these repl files but you should just keep to the `challenge.js`, Console and the instructions.
- Each `challenge.js` comes with an empty challenge function, all these functions take in *parameters* which will work as your input.
  - Do not change the name of the function or the variables in the `challenge.js` Your code should go inside the challenge function.
  - The challenge function will be ran multiple times for different *tests* logging their results to the console.
  - Parameters act as variables for that function, and there value will change each time your function is tested.
  - To see what values are being sent to the challenge function, try *un-commenting* the line that says `export const showInput = true`.
- Each of these challenge functions are looking for a *return* value.
  - returns are used to get values out of the function and in this case is how to give an answer.
  - you can still use console logs to get a better grasp of how your function and data are working, but this will not satisfy the tests.
- These are meant to challenge you and get you thinking. You might not be able to complete it before lecture begins (that's ok).

With that out of the way here is your first challenge.

## Hello World!

The challenge function will be given a `language` (your input) as a *string*, `return` the corresponding *hello world* from the variables also found in the `challenge.js` file

```javascript
function challenge(language){
 
}

challenge('english') //should return 'Hello World'
challenge('spanish') // should return 'Hola Mundo'

```
