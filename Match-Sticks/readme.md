**Match Sticks**

### Description

Given a number of match sticks return the number of houses you can make with them. Each match stick house needs 2 walls, 1 floor, and 2 sticks for an angled roof (5 for one house). What makes match stick houses special is they can share walls. So It won't simply be a division problem. Look at the example below

```
given 12 sticks
/\/\/
|_|_|_|
there are enough sticks to build 2 whole houses with 3 left over
```

The answer for this example would be `2`
