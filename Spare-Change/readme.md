### Description

Given an array of coins, and a cost, return `true` or `false` on whether you have enough money. The array will always be come in the same order and have the same length. [nickles, dimes, quarters]. These numbers are how many of each coin you have.


```javascript
challenge([2,5,2], 1.05) // -> true
```

- all the coins added up = 1.10, which is enough to buy an item that is $1.05.
