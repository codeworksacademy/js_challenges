**Bananas**

### Description

Grown in more than 150 countries, it is widely believed there are more than 1, 000 types of bananas in the world, which are subdivided into 50 groups.

Thankfully code is not so complex, at least when it comes to data types. Infact we can write a function to identify the types of data passed to it. You will be given a argument and it is your job to parse out the data type of it. We don't actually care what the value of the data is we are just trying to figure out it's type. 'Hello' would be a string, 38 would be number, true a bool etc.

```javascript
function bananas(data) {

}

bananas(7) // -> number
```

**example Output:**

```
1 number
```

* 36 is a the data type of number
