**Is Spy**

### Description

You've been hired by a foreign agency in charge of sorting through the staff ledger. After a few incidents it has been determined that there is a spy among them! You are to write the algorithm so when given a name you can determine if that person is a spy. As it goes all spies can't help but put the word `spy` in their under cover names. Although it may not be in the right order. Given a name as a string, return true or false whether the letters s,p and y appear in the name *in any order*.

```javascript

function isSpy(name){
  
}

isSpy('Stefaniya Pyatoslavivna') // -> true
```

**example Output:**
```
1 true
```
- `S`tefania `Py`atoslavivna' contains all 3 letters
