**Pyramids**

### Description

The Pharaoh has a massive pile of evenly cut bricks that are all pefectly 1 Meter squared. Yes we are only working in two dimensions to keep things simple... 

The Pharaoh needs to know how tall his Pyramid will be given the total number of bricks he currently has in his brick yard. Of course because this is a pyramid and not a single tower there is some sort of tricky math involved that that Pharoah can't quite draw out. 

You have been hired to figure out how tall the pyramid will be given `x:number` of total bricks.

```javascript

function pyramid(totalBricks){
  
}

pyramid(7) // -> 3 Meters Tall
```

**example Output:**

```
3   [=]
2  [=][=]
1 [=][=][=]
```
- 6 bricks are used to reach a height of 3 meters. While 1 brick remains unusable
